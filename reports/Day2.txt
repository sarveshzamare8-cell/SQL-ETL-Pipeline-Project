Tasks Completed

1.Opened the staging_raw table in DB Browser and reviewed all columns.

2.Ran SQL queries to check for data quality issues:

Null or empty values

Invalid email formats

Duplicate purchase_id values

Negative or zero prices

3.Checked for incorrect phone lengths

4.Found that the first row was empty → deleted it, reducing row count from 201 → 200 rows.

5.Renamed all columns correctly (purchase_id, name, email, country, product, price, payment_method, timestamp, address, phone).

6.Re-ran validation checks after renaming to confirm:
No duplicate purchase_id values

No null values in the main fields

Email formats now valid

7.Confirmed that the staging table is now clean and ready for transformation.

Output of Day 2

Staging table cleaned
