Objective

Perform data analytics on the cleaned production table and generate SQL queries for business insights.

Tasks Completed
1. Calculated Total Revenue

Used SQL to find the overall revenue generated from all purchases in the dataset.

2. Analyzed Revenue by Country

Grouped purchases by country to identify which regions contribute the highest revenue.

3. Identified Top 10 Customers

Ran SQL queries to find the top 10 customers based on total amount spent.
This helps understand customer value and purchasing behavior.

4. Analyzed Payment Methods

Counted the number of transactions based on payment methods such as:

Credit Card

Debit Card

UPI

PayPal

Others

This helps determine customer preferences.

5. Found Most Purchased Product

Checked which product was purchased the most times across all transactions.

6. Analyzed Order Distribution by Country

Calculated total orders from each country to identify strong and weak markets.

7. Created Analytics SQL File

Stored all analytics queries in a single file named:

analytics_queries.sql

This improves project readability and demonstrates SQL skills clearly.

Summary

Day 5 focused on performing real-world analytics using the cleaned production table.
Generated valuable insights such as revenue, customer behavior, product performance, and payment method usage.
The project now includes both ETL and analytical components.
